# gas_electric_early_warning
Case study of the gas-electric early warning system in Zhejiang Province, which uses MATLAB_R2023b. 
In the folder "small_case", the file "proactive_control.m" shows the main procedure of the gas-electric early warning followed by the proactive control method; the file "passive_control.m" shows the basis of comparison; the file "paspdp.m" shows the plotting program. 
In the folder "large_case", the file "proactive_control.m" shows the main procedure of the gas-electric early warning followed by the proactive control method; the file "passive_control.m" shows the basis of comparison; the file "plot_proactive.m" shows the plotting program. 
In the folder "early_warning_data", there exhibit global natural gas power generation data, globle gas pipeline infrastructure data, and coupled gas-electricity system data in Zhejiang Province.
